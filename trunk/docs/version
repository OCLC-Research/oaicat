which requests get through.

It was mainly things like "throws" that were declared but never used and
private methods and variables that were never used. I'm fairly confident
that their removal won't affect anyone's custom classes.

hardcoding them relative to $TOMCAT_HOME

- Exit the loop in RecordHandler so no more than one metadata record gets created.

2005-07-29 1.5.38
Enhancement:
- Added optional OAIHandler.extraXmlns parameter to oaicat.properties handler. This string will be inserted into the <oai:OAI-PMH> to allow extra xmlns declarations to be included in the response.

2005-03-25 1.5.35

Bug Fix:
- Force identifier parameters to conform to URI syntax or else throw a badArgument error.

Enhancement:
- Added "info:ofi/pro" to the list of namespaces that can be parsed by XMLFileOAICatalog.
- Added XSLTproCrosswalk
- Changed the Redirect extension verb to return the oai_dc record if no dc:identifier is found.

2003-06-13 1.5.13
Bug Fix:
- Allow for missing User-Agent in HTTP header.

2003-06-05 1.5.12
Bug Fix:
- XML Encode the <identifier> portion of the response.

2003-06-03 1.5.11
Bug Fix:
- Fixed a few more bugs in JDBCOAICatalog where OAI-type Exceptions were
  being caught and transformed into Error 500 failures.

2003-05-14 1.5.10
Bug Fix:
- Fixed a bug in JDBCOAICatalog where invalid identifiers weren't being reported properly from GetRecord verbs.

2003-05-05 1.5.10
Enhancement:
- Add call to ServerVerb.init for extension verbs to allow them to initialize themselves.
- Add call to HttpServletRequest.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") to handle escaped characters in the URL.

2003-04-29 1.5.9
Bug Fix:
- Moved extension verbs so they only work from baseURL + "/extension". This should satisfy those who worry about adding non-OAI verbs to the baseURL. Also changed the property from ServerVerbs.* to ExtensionVerbs.*
- Fixed ListRecords and ListIdentifiers to convert blanks back to '+'. Hopefully, this won't cause people too much grief.

2003-04-21 1.5.8
Enhancements:
- Added an optional Redirect verb to support POIs (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/resolver-guidelines/.
- Added JUnit tests to the Ant build scripts.
- Added a little more documentation
- Improved version control.
- Fixed a bug where setting the HTTP Content-Encoding prevented the return of HTTP status codes.

2003-04-17 1.5.7
Bg fixes:
- Removed URLEncoder.encode() calls in RecordFactory and ServerVerb because URLEncoding setSpecs isn't the right solution. I don't recall why I did this in the first place, and now I worry that it will break someone's existing installation because they are gone. If so, hopefully they will contact me and we can fix it propertly.
Enhancements
- Add an OAIHarvester.forceRender property to discourage the harvesting of proprietary data.
- Add a RecordFactory.encodeSetSpec parameter (default=true) since it's not really supposed to encode colons. Eventually, this will need to be fixed properly to encode only those characters that actually require it.

2003-03-28 1.5.6
Enhancements
- Allow for additional verbs to be configured in oaicat.properties.
- Added an optional GetMetadata verb.

2003-03-06 1.5.5
Enhancements
- Added an optional OAIHandler.renderForOldBrowsers property to recognize old "Mozilla" browsers and render the response into HTML if an OAIHandler.styleSheet property is present.

2002-11-18 1.5.4
Bug fixes:
- Removed 'compress' compression option since there is some question about its correctness.
- URLEncoded the request element's set value.
- Fixed a bug in the JDBC implementation that caused resumptionTokens to always respond with initial results.
Enhancements
- Added a FileSystem implementation and made it the default instead of the silly useless DummyOAICatalog.
- Moved the toolkit element to the bottom of the Identify response to make it less prominent.

2002-11-01 1.5.3
Bug fixes:
- Made JDBC2oai_dc real.
- Change setSpec handling to allow them to be collected from the database itself.
- Use a HashMap to represent a record rather than depending on the cursor of an entire resultSet.
- Changes too numerous to mention regarding JDBCOAICatalog. If you're using it, consider using JDBCLimitedOAICatalog instead. It should be more memory effecient.
- Added a new class named NoRecordMatchException which is a more appropriate name than NoItemsMatchException. Both work, though.
- Fixed a bug in the Identify response where the toolkit description wasn't passing validation.
- Changed the default 'from' and 'until' dates to something more realistic.


2002-10-22 1.5.2
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in the JDBC implementation that caused resumptionToken type
  requests to return the initial set of records each time.
- Made resumptionTokens in the JDBC implementation idempotent.
- Changed the default 'from' date from 01/01/0000 to 01/01/0001 to
  accommodate Oracle JDBC limitations.
- Fixed a problem with ListMetadataFormats in the JDBC implementation where it didn't recognize oaiidentifiers that weren't in sets.

2002-10-16 1.5.1
Enhancements:
- Added a JDBC implementation

2002-10-04 1.5
Enhancements:
- Added toolkit description to the Identify response and version number tracking.

2002-10-02 1.4
Bug Fixes:
- Added a check for bad arguments when they accompany resumptionTokens
  to satisfy the OAI repository registration validator.

2002-09-27 1.3
Enhancements:
- Added cusomization instructions to the Readme.txt file.
- Improved javadocs.

2002-09-25 1.2
Bug Fixes:
- Changed the way <description> elements are managed by the Identify verb.

2002-09-20 1.1
Bug Fixes:

  Explorer validation.

Enhancements:
